# Classify Job Titles
Given a job title like "junior data analyst" categorize it as one of "finance", "sales", or "technology".

### Hypothetical Use Case
Suppose we own a professional networking site similar to LinkedIn. Users sign up, type some information about themselves, and then roam the network looking for jobs/connections/etc. Until recently, we only required users to enter their current job title, but now we’re asking them what industry they work in. New users are supplying this info as they sign up, but old users aren’t bothering to update their information. So, we need to build a text classification model to do it for them.
