# Predict Income
Predict the average income of a person given his city, region, and country.

### Notes
This problem is particularly challenging because of the hierarchical structure of the data: City < Region < Country. For a random person, it makes sense to predict his income close to the income of other people in his city.  But if few or no training samples of people in his city exist, you will have to put more weight on the income level of other people in his region (and so on).

### Models
At this time, two [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) models are given:

 - **predict_income_xgb1.R** - uses average income per City, Region, and Country to train an xgboost model
 - **predict_income_xgb2.R** - one-hot-encodes City, Region, and Country, generating a sparse matrix to train an xgboost model
