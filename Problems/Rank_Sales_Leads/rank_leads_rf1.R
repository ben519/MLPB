# Some thoughts & ideas come to mind
# - CompanyName could be useful in theory, but we're not going to deal with the complexities of NLP feature engineering here...
# - Phone number probably isn't useful... but maybe AreaCode is since it should separate the samples by geography => demographics
# - It probably makes sense to order the Contact values: general line < other < manager < owner (this affects the model's construction)
# - Website (like PhoneNumber) is too unique to be useful, but maybe businesses that use .net and .org are less likely to buy our software

# Now let's see what our overall hit ratio is
train[, list(Samples=.N, Sales=sum(Sale), HitRatio = sum(Sale)/.N)]  # .35

#======================================================================================================
# Feature engineering and transforming the training dataset

# Some things to keep in mind
# - We have to deal with missing values (NAs). We could impute mean or median into their place, but this is likely to degrade
#   the model's performace. NAs here have special meaning. E.g. FacebookLikes = NA means the company does not have a facebook.
#   This has very different implications than, "The company has a facebook, but we didn't bother to track how many Likes it has"
# - randomForest only accepts numeric and factor values and it can't handle NAs. So we need to convert categorical features to factors
#   and change NAs to some specific value, e.g. "NA_Val", or -1 for numeric features. Also need to convert Sale from logical to factor
# - randomForest can only handle factors with up to 53 unique levels. We won't run into this issue since out dataset is small, but for
#   illustration we'll create a "catch all" group for TypeOfBusiness to use for uncommon business types
# - The test set could have a TypeOfBusiness not seen in the training set. Need to prepare for that!

#--------------------------------------------------
# TypeOfBusiness

# Generate a map to map the values in TypeOfBusiness to a new field, TOBCategory
tobMap <- train[, list(Samples=.N), by=TypeOfBusiness]
tobMap[, TOBCategory := ifelse(Samples < 2, "Other_Val", TypeOfBusiness)]  # Map all uncommon categories to "Other_Val"
tobMap[is.na(TypeOfBusiness), TOBCategory := "NA_Val"]  # Map NA categories to "NA_Val"
tobMap[, TOBCategory := factor(TOBCategory)]  # convert to factor

# train
train[tobMap, TOBCategory := TOBCategory, on="TypeOfBusiness"]

# test
test[tobMap, TOBCategory := TOBCategory, on="TypeOfBusiness"]
test[is.na(TOBCategory), TOBCategory := "Other_Val"]  # NAs will be generated for brand new categories. Send these to "Other_val"

#--------------------------------------------------
# Contact

# In this case, we know all the possible contact types
contacts <- c("general line", "other", "manager", "owner")  # Note the order of the elements
train[, Contact := factor(Contact, ordered=TRUE)]  # IMPORTANT! Note the 'ordered=TRUE' bit
test[, Contact := factor(Contact, ordered=TRUE)]

#--------------------------------------------------
# AreaCode

train[, AreaCode := substr(PhoneNumber, 1, 3)]  # train
test[, AreaCode := substr(PhoneNumber, 1, 3)]  # test

# We need to convert AreaCode to type factor
areacodes <- unique(c(train$AreaCode, test$AreaCode))  # Get all the unique area codes

# Create a separate feature called Target. Then we can still do stuff like train[, list(Sales=sum(Sales))]
